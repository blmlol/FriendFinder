# FriendFinder- A small Web App to match you with compatible friends


## Project Overview
The FriendFinder is a project that involves a few components: client-side interface, an express.js server, and server-side routing. The app is designed to take in user's answers to a survey of 10 questions including their name and an image link. The user's information and answers will be added to a friend's list. The app will return the name and submitted picture of the friend that answered the most similar to the user! 

## Building the App
1. We will first need to initialize our Github Repository and create the following files:
    1. server.js - this file will contain the main server code 
    2. home.html and survey.html - these will be in the public folder and will contain the client-side interfacing
    3. apiRoutes.js and htmlRoutes.js- these will be the route handling files for handling get and post requests from the client.
    4. friends.js - this will act as pseudo database that we can store and retrieve data from
2. Posting data from the client will be handled within the survey.html page within a script tag as opposed to an external js file
